# SporeFront
Sporefront is a strategic game where players control fungi or insects on the Fungorium planet. Mycologists grow fungal networks and develop bodies, while Entomologists collect nutrients from spores. The goal is to evolve the most fungal bodies or gather the most nutrients. This repo contains the game's code and assets.
